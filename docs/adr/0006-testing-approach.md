## Context

As detailed in [principles - test driven development](../principles.md#test-driven-development), we **use test driven development**.

Automated tests _first_ and foremost **require fast and reliable feedback**, and _secondly_ some archetypes assume a non deployed application (unit test, component test, integration tests): both requirements seemed difficult to technically achieve in the current mu-stack. 

Furthermore, functionally and technically achieving an operation having its application logic, technical configuration and any other configuration is **scattered over several microservices**, a small configuration change can thus easily break functionality, making it difficult to judge the impact of a change on the whole system or the operation.

Since we've implemented a [technically optimized backend](0009-technically-optimize-backend.md) we are able to create more atomic methods of application / business logic in lpdc-management service, which makes previous technical difficulties more manageable.

## Decision

- We will write **unit tests** and **integration tests** in **frontend-lpdc** project directly. We will **use the ember testing framework**. 
- We will write **unit tests** and **integration tests** for **lpdc management**. We will use [**Jest**](https://jestjs.io/) using [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). We will set up a docker test container using virtuoso, and ensure that the production code can be configured to point to this test container.
- We will write, if possible, **unit tests** and **integration tests** for **lpdc publish**. We will use [**Jest**](https://jestjs.io/) using [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).
- We will write **data integrity tests** in **lpdc management**. These tests will create a report identifying all incorrect data in our database, covering both additional and missing data.
- Each business operation implemented will also have a supporting **end 2 end tests**. These will _not_ serve to verify the complete business logic of the method, but more a verification that all components are wired together correctly. We will write them for 1. **lpdc-management rest api** 2. the **mu-cl-resources configuration / endpoints** 3. the **frontend-lpdc (and the other services)** 4. **all other config from app-lpdc-digitaal-loket**. End to end means that **all containers are configured**: identifier, dispatcher, database (mu-auth), virtuoso, delta notifier, migrations, cache, resource, ldes-consumer-conceptsnapshot-ipdc, lpdc-management, lpdc-publish, frontend-lpdc. We will use [**Playwright**](https://playwright.dev/) using [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for writing the **end-to-end tests**.
- Since IPDC is outside our system boundary, we will **create an ipdc-stub** that mimics IPDC. This will be used to verify the behaviour of _reading the ldes-stream from IPDC_ and _pushing instances to IPDC_.
- A separate docker config for **latest** and **local** development will be created. The latest config will run with docker 'latest' versions of frontend-lpdc, lpdc-management, lpdc-publish. The development version will run from the local code, started with node or ember in development mode.
- The [Continous Integration build](../deployment.md#continuous-integration) will also run the complete test set based on the latest containers, and the one from lpdc-management.

## Consequences

- Starting the containers for the end-to-end tests will be slow. 
- We will need to reduce the restart time of the test containers.
