Accepted

## Context

We need to record the architectural decisions made on this project.

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records, as [described by Michael Nygard](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions).

## Consequences

See Michael Nygard's article, linked above. For a lightweight ADR toolset, see Nat Pryce's [adr-tools](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools).

## Notes

For convenience and consistency, you can install [ADR Tools](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools/).
You can find the instructions for installing it in the Windows git bash
[here](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools/blob/master/INSTALL.md#git-for-windows-git-bash); for step 4 on Windows install execute in _git bash shell_
