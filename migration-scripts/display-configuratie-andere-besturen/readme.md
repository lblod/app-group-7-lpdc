# DisplayConfiguration andere besturen

add-display-configuration-andere-besturen.sparql file needs to be executed multiple times because there is a limit on how many triples can be inserted at once.

If one of the bestuurseenheden created an instance from a concept when no displayconfiguration existed then the data inserted by the script will be wrong.
the second script will fix this.
